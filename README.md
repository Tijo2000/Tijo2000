# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm a **Data Scientist** with over **2 years of experience** in the **life insurance** and **BFSI sectors**. My expertise lies in building predictive models, machine learning, data analytics, and cloud technologies like **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and AWS**. I‚Äôm passionate about solving complex business problems with data-driven insights and constantly learning new tools and technologies.

## What I Do
- üìä **Data Science & Analytics**: I work on extracting meaningful insights from structured and unstructured data, creating predictive models for business use cases such as customer behavior prediction, churn analysis, and agent activation.
- üß† **Machine Learning**: I build and deploy models using libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **CatBoost**, and **TensorFlow** for predictive analytics and automation in the insurance industry.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Computing (GCP)**: I design scalable, cloud-native architectures for deploying data pipelines, machine learning models, and data analytics workflows.
- üõ† **Tech Stack**: 
  - Programming: Python, SQL, Bash
  - ML Libraries: Scikit-learn, CatBoost, TensorFlow
  - Cloud: GCP (BigQuery, Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Storage), AWS (Sagemaker , Lambda , S3 , ECR , API Gateway
  - Tools: Jupyter, Docker, Git, Kubernetes

## Featured Projects

### 1. Life Insurance Agent Activation Prediction
**Project Purpose**: Developed a predictive model to forecast agent activity for a life insurance company, helping the business plan resource allocation and improve sales strategies.

- **Key Features**: 
  - Predicts whether an agent will be active in selling policies in the next month.
  - Tackles seasonality with time-series features and rolling averages.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, CatBoost, GCP (BigQuery, Compute Engine)
